BUILT-IN VARIABLES,,
What is the variable name for the current price?,"The  `close`  variable holds both the price at the close of historical bars and the current price when an is running on the realtime bar. If the script is a running on the realtime bar, by default it runs only at the bar’s close. If the  `calc_on_every_tick`  parameter of the  `strategy()`  declaration statement is set to  `true`  , the strategy will behave as an indicator and run on every price change of the realtime bar. To access the close of the previous bar’s close in Pine, use  `close[1]`  . In Pine, brackets are used as the .","close

What is the code for an up bar?,"Once you have defined the  `upBar`  variable, if you wanted a boolean variable to be  `true`  when the last three bars were up bars, you could write: You could also achieve the same using: which produces a value of  `1`  every time the  `upBar`  boolean variable is true, and adds the number of those values for the last 3 bars. When that rolling sum equals  `3`  ,  `threeUpBars`  is true. If you wanted to have a condition true when there were 7 or more up bars in the last 10, you could use: If you need to define up and down bars and want to account for all possibilities, make sure one of those definitions allows for the case where  `open`  and  `close`  are equal: In this case, when  `close == open`  ,  `upBar`  will be false and  `dnBar`  true. If you want to go one step further in defining what constitutes an up and down bar, you can use these functions. They are useful on smaller timeframes when price does not move during bars. Note that these functions taken together do not account for all possible situations, as none of them will return  `true`  when price does not move during a bar and the bar closes at the same level as the previous bar. These functions also use price values that are rounded to tick precision (see the following FAQ entry for the reasons why that can be useful):","upBar=close>open

Why do the OHLC built-ins sometimes return different values than the ones shown on the chart?,"Data feeds sometimes contains prices that exceed the symbol’s tick precision. When this happens, the value returned by the  `close`  built-in may be different from the chart’s close value. Chart prices are always rounded to tick precision, but built-ins are not. This makes it possible for occurrences like the one illustrated here, where the exchange feed contains a close price of 30181.07 that is more precise than the symbol’s  `0.1`  tick size. In that case, the chart will show 30181.1 but the  `close`  built-in’s value will be the feed’s value of 30181.07. The difference is subtle but such discrepancies do occur and should be taken into consideration when troubleshooting unexpected script behavior or designing precision-critical calculations. Cross detections are an example of calculations that can be affected. One solution is to force a rounding of OHLC built-ins and use the rounded values in further calculations, as is done in this example script, which spots discrepancies between the evaluation of the  `open == close`  conditional expression with and without rounded values:  You can also use this version of the function which returns rounded OHLC values in a single call:","close

Why do some functions and built-ins evaluate incorrectly inifor ternary (?) blocks?,"An important change to the way conditional statement blocks are evaluated was introduced with v4 of Pine. Many coders are not aware of it or do not understand its implications. explains the change and provides a list of for functions/built-ins which are NOT affected by the constraints. We’ll explain what’s happening here, and how to avoid the problems caused by code that does not take the change into account. This is what’s happening: This is the PineCoders “If Law”: While this can easily be forgotten in the creative excitement of coding your latest idea, you will save yourself lots of pain by understanding and remembering this. This is a major change from previous versions of Pine. It has far-reaching consequences and not structuring code along these lines can have particularly pernicious consequences because the resulting incorrect behavior is sometimes discrete (appearing only here and there) and random. To avoid problems, you need to be on the lookout for 2 conditions: A conditional expression that can only be evaluated with incoming, new bar information (i.e., using series variables like  `close`  ). This excludes expressions using values of literal, const, input or simple forms because they do not change during the script’s execution, and so when you use them, the same block in the  `if`  statement is guaranteed to execute on every bar. if you are not familiar with Pine forms and types. When condition A is met, and the if block(s) contain(s) functions or built-ins NOT in the list of exceptions, i.e., which require evaluation on every bar to return a correct result, then condition B is also met. This is an example where an apparently inoffensive built-in like  `vwap`  is used in a ternary.  `vwap`  is not in the list of exceptions, and so when condition A is realized, it will require evaluation prior to entry in the if block. You can flip between 3 modes: #1 where condition A is fulfilled and #2 and #3 where it is not. You will see how the unshielded value (“upVwap2” in the thick line) will produce incorrect results when mode 1 is used.","sma()

Can I use the:=operator to assign values to past values of a series?,"No. Past values in Pine series are read-only, as is the past in real life. Only the current bar instance (  `variableName[0]`  ) of a series variable can be assigned a value, and when you do, the  `[]`  history-referencing operator must be used—only the variable name. What you can do is create a series with the values you require in it as the script is executed, bar by bar. The following code creates a new series called  `range`  with a value containing the difference between the bar’s  `close`  and  `open`  , but only when it is positive. Otherwise, the series value is zero. In the previous example, we could determine the value to assign to the  `range`  series variable as we were going over each bar in the dataset because the condition used to assign values was known on that bar. Sometimes, you will only obtain enough information to identify the condition after a number of bars have elapsed. In such cases, a  `for`  loop must be used to go back in time and analyse past bars. This will be the case in situations where you want to identify fractals or pivots. See the from the User Manual, for example.","variableName[0]

Why do some logical expressions not evaluate as expected when na values are involved?,"Pine logical expressions have 3 possible values:  `true`  ,  `false`  and  `na`  . Whenever an  `na`  value is used in a logical expression, the result of the logical expression will be na. Thus, contrary to what could be expected,  `na == na`  ,  `na == true`  ,  `na == false`  or  `na != true`  all evaluate to  `na`  . Furthermore, when a logical expression evaluates to  `na`  , the false branch of a conditional statement will be executed. This may lead to unexpected behavior and entails that special cases must be accounted for if you want your code to handle all possible logical expression results according to your expectations. Let’s take a case where, while we are debugging code, we want to compare two variables that should always have the same value, but where one of the variables or both can have an na value. When that is the case, neither  `a == b`  nor  `a != b`  will return true or false, as they both return na. When we undestand this, we can see why the first  `bgcolor()`  line in the following code shows no background. While you could expect the  `a != b`  logical expression to be true and thus the background to appear lime because the value of variable  `a`  does not equal the value of  `b`  , this is not the case. Because the logical expression returns  `na`  , the false branch of the ternary is executed and no color is plotted in the background. The second  `bgcolor()`  line will produce the behavior we expect. You will see this if you comment out the first one and uncomment this second line. The other lines show different variations of the concept. This code shows a more practical example using a test for pivots.  If you are comparing two signals and want to be sure they produce the same values all the time, including  `na`  values, you can use code like this to make sure they are rigorously the same on all bars. It compares the value of  `rsi(close, 14)`  to an external input:","true

The markets you can reach from a Pine script are limited by the execution engine you will use. There is a healthy ecosystem of execution engines able to accept incoming TradingView alerts containing orders intended for markets. Our lists a few of them. While they do not cover the entirety of world markets, you will be able to reach quite a few, conventional or crypto. These are the steps you will typically need to go through to build a working automated trading system from a Pine study/strategy: For information on creating alert events from studies, see the .

How can I calculate custom statistics in a strategy?,"When you issue orders in a strategy by using any of the  `strategy.*()`  function calls, you do the equivalent of sending an order to your broker/exchange. The broker emulator takes over the management of those orders and simulates their execution when the conditions in the orders are fulfilled. In order to detect the execution of those orders, you can use changes in the built-in variables such as and . This script demonstrates how to accomplish this. The first part calculates the usual conditions required to manage trade orders and issues those orders. The second part detects order fill events and calculates various statistics from them. The script also demonstrates how to calculate position sizes using a fixed percentage of the equity and the risk incurred when entering the trade, which is defined as the distance to the entry stop. The default strategy parameters also use commission. All strategies should account for some fees, either in the form of commission or in slippage (which can be used to simulate spreads), as nobody usually trades for free, and ignoring trading fees is a common mistake which can be costly:","strategy.*()

TEXT,,
How can I place text on chart?,"You can display text using one of the following methods: The or functions are useful to display fixed text on bars. There is no limit to the number of bars you may use those functions on, but you cannot decide at runtime which text to print. One call can print only one character on a bar. Using ’s  `text`  parameter, you can plot a string. When you want to print two different characters on bars depending on a condition that can only be evaluated at runtime, you must use two distinct calls, each one printing on a different condition: We need two distinct calls here because the argument to the  `char`  parameter in must be of “input string” type, which means it can be determined by an input, but not calculated dynamically at runtime. This for example, would not work: Labels are useful when the text you want to display needs to vary from bar to bar. They are required when, for example, you want to print values on the chart such as pivot levels, which cannot be known before the script executes. There is a limit to the number of labels that can be displayed by a script. By default, it is approximately the 50 latest labels drawn by the script. You can increase that value up to 500 using the  `max_labels_count`  parameter of or . This shows how you can use labels to display more or less the equivalent of our first example using labels. Notice how we can now determine both the label’s text and position at runtime, so using “series string” arguments: Tables are useful to display text that in a fixed position of the indicator’s visual space, untethered to chart bars.","plotchar()

How can I detect a specific date/time?,"We will be using the  `year`  ,  `month`  ,  `dayofmonth`  ,  `hour`  ,  `minute`  and  `second`  built-in variables to achieve this here. All these variables return their namesake’s value at the bar the script is running on, and , as is documented in the Pine User Manual. So in order for the target date/time you will enter in the script’s to match the date/time on the chart, you will need to ensure your chart’s time is set to display the exchange’s timezone, as is shown in step 1 in the chart. Once that is done, step 2 shows how the chart will automatically display the exchange’s timezone at the bottom. In this chart we have set the hour to “12” and the minute to “30” in the script’s inputs. The bright green bar shows when our target time is reached, and the lighter green bars show the bars where the condition we are testing is true, i.e., since we haven’t entered a specific date, the cycle repeats while our time threshold has been reached each day. You can test for either condition in your script. You can see at point 3 on the chart that the time matches “12:30”, which would not be the case if the chart’s time had not been set to the exchange’s timezone. Coders often want to save a value on the transition to the target time. We show here how one could save the  `open`  every time the target date/time is reached. Note how, when plotting the saved value, we test for transitions when applying color to the plot, so that we do not plot any color on transitions.

Can I time the duration of a condition?,"The short answer is no and the reason is because of the rollback process that happens during the realtime bar, as is explained in the User Manual’s page on Pine’s . To time the duration of an event, we would need to detect its beginning, save the time at that point (e.g., in a  `timeSaved`  variable), and for each subsequent execution of the script, check if the condition is still true and if so, use  `timenow - timeSaved`  to determine the number of milliseconds for which the condition has been true. This, however, cannot be done in Pine because the value of all variables are rolled back to their starting values at the beginning of the realtime bar before each realtime bar iteration of the script. This makes it impossible for the saved time in our  `timeSaved`  variable to perpetuate across subsequent iterations of the script in the same realtime bar. Only its value at the realtime bar’s close, so the script’s last iteration in the realtime bar, is preserved.","timeSaved

ALERTS,See the script for alert-creating code.,
How do I make an alert available from my script?,"Two steps are required: See the User Manual page on . Code to create an alert condition looks like: When you need to create multiple alerts you can repeat the method above for every alert you want your indicator to generate, but you can also use the method shown in . Here, all the different alert conditions are bunched up in one  `alertcondition()`  statement. In this case, you must provide the means for users to first select which conditions will trigger the alert in the dialog box. When all the required conditions are selected, the user creates an alert using the only alert this indicator makes available, but since TradingView remembers the state of the when creating an alert, only the selected conditions will trigger the alert once it’s created, even if selections are modified by the user after the alert is created. When more than one condition can trigger a single alert, you will most probably need to have visual cues for each condition so that when users bring up a chart on which an alert triggered they can figure out which condition caused the alert to trigger. This is a method that allows users of your script to customize the alert to their needs. When TradingView creates an alert, it saves a snapshot of the environment that will enable the alert to run on the servers. The elements saved with an alert are:","alertcondition()

There is currently no way to create an alert for all the symbols in a watchlist or for the Screener. By using a call for each symbol (maximum 40), you can monitor more than one symbol with the same script, and generate alerts containing the symbol’s name using placeholders in your alert’s text. See this for more information. If one of the generic indicators supplied with the Screener suits your needs and your symbols are tagged with a color label, you can create an alert on those markets from within the Screener.",security()

In Method 2 we watch for the condition as the script is executing on each successive bar, initialize our distance to 0 when we encounter the condition, and until we encounter the condition again, add 1 to the distance at each bar. In method 3 we save the bar’s index when the condition occurs, and we then use the difference between the current bar’s index and that one to derive the distance between the two.

While it is useful to count occurrences of a condition in the last x bars, it is also worth studying because the technique it uses will allow you to write much more efficient Pine code than one using a  `for`  loop when applied to other situations. There are situations when using a  `for`  loop is the only way to realize what we want, but in most cases they can be avoided.  `for`  loops are the only way to achieve types of backward analysis when the criteria used are only known after the bars to analyze have elapsed.","sum()

Can I merge two or more indicators into one?,"Sure, but start by looking at the scale each one is using. If you’re thinking of merging a moving average indicator designed to plot on top of candles and in relation to them, you are going to have problems if you also want to include and indicator showing volume bars in the same script because their values are not on the same scale. Once you’ve made sure your scales will be compatible (or you have devised a way of ), it’s a matter of gathering the code from all indicators into one script and removing any variable name collisions so each indicator’s calculations retain their independence and integrity. You may need to convert some code from one version of Pine to another, so pay attention to the Pine version used in each codebase.",
How can I rescale an indicator from one scale to another?,"The answer depends on whether you know the minimum/maximum possible values of the signal to be rescaled. If you don’t know them, as is the case for volume or MACD where the maximum value is unknown, then you will need to use a function that uses past history to determine the minimum/maximum values, as in the  `normalize()`  function here. While this is an imperfect solution since the minimum/maximum need to be discovered as your script progresses bar to bar, we prefer it to the technique using  `lowest()`  and  `highest()`  over a fixed period because it uses the minimum/maximum values for the complete set of elapsed bars rather than a subset of fixed length. The ideal solution would be to know in advance the minimum/maximum values for the whole series to beginning the normalization process, but this is currently not possible in Pine. If you know the minimum/maximum values of the series (RSI, Stoch, etc.), then you should use the  `rescale()`  function, which only translates the values into another space without changing their relative proportion. Here, we show how to present RSI and volume in one part of our our indicator’s pane, in the -100/100 range. As RSI is a bounded indicator with known values between 0/100, we can rescale it to the -100/100 and not lose any of its information. Volume, however, is another story. As it is unbounded, we need to normalize it to the same -100/100 scale because we want its plot line to be constrained to the same space as our rescaled RSI. Volume is shown as the black line. In addition to RSI and volume in one part of our indicator’s space, let’s say we also want to show CCI. CCI is an unbounded indicator. While 75% of its values should lie in the -100/100 space, there are no fixed upper/lower bounds for CCI; it is unbounded. We will thus need to normalize the value. We choose to present it in the 100/500 space of our indicator. CCI is normally displayed with lines at -100 and 100, but in the 100/500 bounded space where we are normalizing CCI, there is no precise equivalent for the -100 and 100 levels, so we arbitraly decide on 200/400: Note that:","normalize()

How can I monitor script run time?,Use the code from the PineCoders . You will be able to time script execution so you can explore different scenarios when developing code and see for yourself which version performs the best.,
How can I save a value when an event occurs?,"The key to this technique is declaring a variable using the  `var`  keyword. While there are other ways to accomplish our task in Pine, this is the simplest. When you declare a variable using the  `var`  keyword, the variable is initialized only once at bar_index zero, rather than on each bar. This has the effect of preserving the variable’s value without the explicit re-assignement that was required in earlier versions of pine where you would see code like this: This was required because the variable was reassigned the value  `0.`  at the beginning of each bar, so to remember its last value, it had to be reset to its last bar’s value on each bar. This is now unnecessary with the  `var`  keyword and makes for cleaner code:","var

How can I count touches of a specific level?,"This technique shows one way to count touches of a level that is known in advance (the median in this case). We keep a separate tally of up and down bar touches, and account for gaps across the median. Every time a touch occurs, we simply save a 1 value in a series. We can then use the function to count the number of ones in that series in the last  `lookBackTouches`  bars. Note that the script can be used in overlay mode to show the median and touches on the chart, or in pane mode to show the counts. Change the setting of the  `overlay`  variable accordingly and re-add the indicator to the chart to implement the change.","sum()

What does theReturn type of 'then' block (series[label]) is not compatible with return type of 'else' block (series[integer])compilation error mean?,"In Pine, an statement returns a value that can be assigned to a variable, so the compiler expects both branches of the statement to return the same type of value which corresponds, as it does in functions, to the type returned by the last statement in the block. When the two types do not match, as is the case here, we get the compiler error above: The solution is to trick the compiler by adding a line using a type-casting function to convert the  `na`  value to the required type. In this case, the first block is returning a id and the second block returns an , so we add  `int(na)`  to the first block and the code compiles (to resolve our conundrum we could have, instead, added a  `label(na)`  line to the first block): If you are unsure of the type to use, solve the problem by simply ending each block with the same casting like  `float(na)`  .","if

How can I initialize a series on specific dates using external data?,"Pine cannot yet use external data sources outside of the TradingView datafeeds. Until it can, external data must be inserted into machine-generated Pine code. This provides a template. The technique will allow for the initialization of approximately 900 values before running into compiler limitations. The technique doesn’t require an  `if`  structure likely to exceed the compiler’s limit of 500 local blocks, but every mutable instance of  `d`  uses a variable count, which will decrease the amount of variables available for the code following the initializations (maximum is 1000 in the global scope). The code is easy to generate and compact:","if

How can I cumulate a value for two exclusive states?,"We first need to define the conditions that will change our states. In this example, we use  `rising/falling`  conditions on  `close`  . A state begins when its trigger condition occurs and lasts until the first occurrence of the trigger condition for the other state. Our triggers are  `beginUp`  and  `beginDn`  . We then declare the two variables that will hold our cumulative volume, one for each state. Since only one state can be active at any given moment, when we are cumulating for one state (using  `volUp`  for an uptrend, for example), the other variable (  `volDn`  in this case) will hold the  `na`  value. We use the  `var`  keyword when declaring the variables so they preserve their value bar to bar. The third and last step in our logic is to determine what value to set our cumulative variables with. We will use  `volUp`  in this discussion, so this line: We must distinguish between three outcomes: Here we display the cumulative count in Weis Wave fashion.
